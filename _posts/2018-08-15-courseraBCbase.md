### Week One: Defining a Blockchain<br>
The blockchain technology supports methods for<br>
* a decentrailized peer-to-peer network
* a collective trust model among unknown peers
* a distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions
<br>

**Decentralization** means the network operates on a user-to-user(or peer-to-peer) basis.

A **Distributed Immutable Ledger** means the data does not sit on one all-powerful server and the data stored in it cannot be deleted or edited

Transactions bring about transfer of value in Bitcion Blockchain. The concept UTXO defines the inputs and outputs of such a transaction.

Once a block is verified and algorithmically agreed by the miners, it is added to the chain of blocks, viz., the blockchain.

An **Unspent Transaction Output(UTXO)** can be spent as an inout in a new transaction.

The main operations in a blockchain are transaction validation and block creation with the consensus of the participants.Yet, there are many underlying implicit operations, as well.

A **Smart Contract** provides the very powerful capability of "code execution" for embedding bussiness logic on a Blockchain.

Significant innovations such as smart contracts have opened up boarder applications for blockchain technology.Private and permissioned-blockchains allow for controlled access to the blockchain, enabling many diverse business models.

In a **Private Blockchain**, access to the Blockchain is limited to selected participants.

**Permissioned or Consortium Blockchain** has the benenits of a public blockchain with allowing only users with "permission" to collaborate and transact.
