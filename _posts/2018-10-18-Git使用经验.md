## 1. 为什么pull或push的时候，会出现 “Merge branch 'master' of … ”这样的log, 怎么处理？
> When you did a git pull, modifications from the remote branch were merged into your local branch. The automatically
generated commit signifies that.
Git will try to do a fast-forward merge if the remote branch is ahead of the local branch, ie., the remote branch has
some commits on top of the commits of the local branch. In this case there is no additional commit. The additional commit 
appears only when the histories of the two branches diverge. In such a case you can rewrite the commit history of your local
branch using 'git rebase' or 'git pull --rebase', performing a fast-forward merge. Rebasing has its own downsides though and
extra merge commits are not always bad -- they are just recording the course of development
